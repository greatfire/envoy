Envoy Server
============

This is an alternate server to the nginx config documented in https://github.com/greatfire/envoy/blob/master/native/README.md

This one additionally supports HTTP Concealed Authentication, with the help of the nginx module from here: https://github.com/guardianproject/http-concealed-auth

This is pretty barebones at this point :)
